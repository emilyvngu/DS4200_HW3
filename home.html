        <p>
            Hi! I’m Emily Nguyen, a curious and creative thinker with a passion for patterns, problem-solving, and making sense of the world through data. I’m currently a Data Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University, where I get to combine my love for numbers with real-world applications. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how seemingly random information can reveal meaningful insights when analyzed the right way. That curiosity led me to explore data science, where I now work on projects that help businesses make smarter decisions and uncover hidden trends. Beyond academics, one of my biggest creative outlets is pottery. I first discovered ceramics in high school and was instantly hooked by the process. There’s something incredibly satisfying about transforming a lump of clay into something tangible and functional. The patience it requires—centering the clay, shaping it, waiting for it to dry—feels almost meditative. Even when pieces don’t turn out perfect, they tell a story. I’ve continued pottery at Northeastern, where I love experimenting with new forms and glazes. The piece below is my very first creation—it’s far from perfect, but it reminds me how rewarding it is to learn and improve with each attempt.
